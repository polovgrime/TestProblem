# TestProblem
Test problem for a job interview

The user should be able to enter a dollar and cents amount (no currency symbols or commas are required for the input) which is less than 2 billion dollars. ie. A number between zero and 2 billion with 2 decimal places.

The application will output the English words that express the number as a string of word (dollars and cents). 

To run the application you need to have .NET 6.0 runtime

To build the application, install .NET 6.0 SDK

```
dotnet build
```
